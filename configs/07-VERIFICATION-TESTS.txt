NETWORK VERIFICATION & TESTING GUIDE
========================================

Run these tests in order. All should PASS ✓

========================================
TEST 1: DHCP ASSIGNMENT
========================================

On each client PC:
1. Click "Command Prompt"
2. Type: ipconfig

EXPECTED:
- IP: 10.0.X.100-254 (matching VLAN)
- Subnet: 255.255.255.0
- Gateway: 10.0.X.1
- DNS: 10.0.10.6

PASS: If all values match expected ranges
FAIL: If IP is 0.0.0.0 or 169.x.x.x (APIPA)

========================================
TEST 2: PING GATEWAY
========================================

From AdminPC1:
ping 10.0.10.1

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
Reply from 10.0.10.1: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=255
Reply from 10.0.10.1: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=255
Reply from 10.0.10.1: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=255
Reply from 10.0.10.1: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=255

PASS: 4 successful replies, 0% loss
FAIL: All timeouts or request timed out

========================================
TEST 3: DNS RESOLUTION
========================================

From any client:
nslookup dhcp.company.local

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
Server: dns.company.local
Address: 10.0.10.6

Name: dhcp.company.local
Address: 10.0.10.5

PASS: Resolves correctly to 10.0.10.5
FAIL: "Server not found" or timeout

========================================
TEST 4: INTER-VLAN COMMUNICATION (ALLOWED)
========================================

From AdminPC1 (VLAN 10) to FinancePC1 (VLAN 20):
ping 10.0.20.100

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
Reply from 10.0.20.100: bytes=32 time=5ms TTL=253
(Note: TTL=253 because packet crossed 2 routers)

PASS: Successful ping, crosses VLANs
FAIL: Request timed out

========================================
TEST 5: GUEST VLAN ISOLATION
========================================

From GuestPC1 (VLAN 40) try to access Admin:
ping 10.0.10.100

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
Destination host unreachable
Request timed out
Request timed out

PASS: ALL pings blocked (security working!)
FAIL: Any successful replies (ACL not working)

========================================
TEST 6: ROUTER STATUS VERIFICATION
========================================

On Router (CLI):

Command: show ip interface brief

EXPECTED:
Interface              IP-Address      Status
GigabitEthernet 0/0    10.0.10.1       up up
GigabitEthernet 0/1    10.0.20.1       up up
GigabitEthernet 0/2    10.0.30.1       up up
GigabitEthernet 0/3    10.0.40.1       up up

PASS: All interfaces "up up"
FAIL: Any interface "down down"

---

Command: show vlan brief

EXPECTED:
VLAN Name          Status
10   Admin         active
20   Finance       active
30   Engineering   active
40   Guest         active

PASS: All 4 VLANs listed as active
FAIL: Any VLAN missing or suspended

---

Command: show access-lists

EXPECTED:
Shows ALLOW_INTER_VLAN and SSH_RESTRICT ACLs
With permit/deny rules listed

PASS: Both ACLs visible with rules
FAIL: ACLs not showing

---

Command: show ip route

EXPECTED:
Shows routes to:
10.0.10.0/24 (Admin)
10.0.20.0/24 (Finance)
10.0.30.0/24 (Engineering)
10.0.40.0/24 (Guest)

PASS: All routes configured
FAIL: Routes missing

========================================
SUMMARY OF TESTS
========================================

Test 1 (DHCP):          [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL
Test 2 (Ping Gateway):  [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL
Test 3 (DNS):           [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL
Test 4 (Inter-VLAN):    [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL
Test 5 (Guest Blocked): [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL
Test 6 (Router Status): [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL

If all 6 tests PASS ✓, your network is fully configured and operational!

========================================
PERFORMANCE METRICS
========================================

Measure these with Wireshark:

Average Ping Time: ___ ms (Target: <10ms)
DNS Query Time: ___ ms (Target: <5ms)
DHCP Lease Time: ___ ms (Target: <1000ms)
Packet Loss: ___% (Target: 0%)
Throughput: ___ Mbps (Target: >90Mbps)

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

If tests FAIL:

1. DHCP fails?
   - Check DHCP server is running
   - Verify DHCP relay on router
   - Check DHCP pools are created

2. DNS fails?
   - Verify DNS server is running
   - Check A records are added
   - Verify DNS IP in DHCP pools

3. Ping fails?
   - Check all interfaces are "up up"
   - Verify ACL is not blocking
   - Check subnet masks

4. Guest blocked works?
   - If Guest CAN reach Admin (FAIL):
     ACL is not working - recheck configuration
   - If Guest CANNOT reach Admin (PASS):
     Security is working! ✓

5. General connectivity issues?
   - Use "show cdp neighbors" to check connections
   - Verify physical links are connected
   - Check for address conflicts
